## Deep Learning Projects Overview
This repository showcases two deep learning projects I completed as part of my academic work. Each project applies core deep learning techniques to a real-world 
problem, demonstrating my understanding of neural network design, training procedures, and evaluation strategies in both computer vision and natural language processing.  

# Project 1: CNN for Handwritten Digit Classification (MNIST)
**Goal:** Classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) using various neural network architectures  
**Techniques Used:**  
Implemented and compared multiple models:  
1.Fully connected networks  
2.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
3.CNNs with dropout layers  
4.Trained and evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and balanced accuracy.  
5.Visualized learned convolutional filters and feature maps.  
6.Experimented with different batch sizes to examine training efficiency and convergence.  
7.Frameworks: PyTorch, scikit-learn, matplotlib  

# Project 2: LSTM Language Modeling on Simple Wikipedia Text  
**Goal:** Train a language model to predict sequences of words using a simplified English corpus.  
**Techniques Used:**  
1.Built a vocabulary of the top 10,000 words from the dataset.  
2.Designed and trained an LSTM-based neural network using Keras (via TensorFlow).  
3.Used Embedding, LSTM, and TimeDistributed(Dense) layers to model word sequences.  
4.Configured custom training loops for forward and backward direction text prediction.  
5.Managed tokenization, padding, batching, and evaluation of model performance.  
6.Integrated TensorBoardX for monitoring training progress.  
7.Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, scikit-learn, tensorboardX
